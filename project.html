    On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
     men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the 
     moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble 
     that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their 
     duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
     from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
      In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing 
      prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
       welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to 
       the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur 
       that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man 
       therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he 
       rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures
    , or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
